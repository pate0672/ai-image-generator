To make this happen, I played around with React Hooks like useState and useRef, making sure everything stayed smooth and interactive. Plus, I threw in some async fetching tricks to keep the data flowing between the app and the AI engines. Oh, and those fancy CSS Animations? They not only made things look slick but also added some fun to the whole experience.

This project was a playground for mixing AI with frontend tech. It showed me how to juggle different tools and ideas to create something that's both cool and user-friendly. I learned loads about how AI can jazz up user experiences while diving deeper into frontend wizardry.

This whole thing wasn't just about the app; it was also about me learning tons of new stuff. It got me thinking more about how AI can spice up our everyday tech. And hey, it was a blast to work on something where tech and creativity collide!

## <b>Technologies Used</b>: JavaScript, ReactJS, OpenAI API, CSS, & HTML.
